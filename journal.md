Raspberry Pi Zero's seem to be out of stock in most places. Might have been out of stock for a while. I've heard a common thread about people buying out the whole stock and then reselling. 

In any case, there's quite a bit of info kicking around about hooking up a HX711 to a Raspberry Pi so that might not be too complicated of a process. 

I could start to spend some time on the frontend app and stub out some fake data in the meantime. Need to probably come up with a way to see what the "real time" recording is looking like as your recording it, and then looking at historical data.
